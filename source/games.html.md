Here are some games I've worked on:

## [Astrosmash](http://astrosmash.spilth.org)

An [Astrosmash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrosmash) clone written using [Phaser](http://www.phaser.io). The source code is at <https://github.com/spilth/astrosmash-phaser>

## [Marble Mania 2003](https://vimeo.com/14423454)

An Unreal Tournament 2003 mod inspired the classic arcade game [Marble Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness). I created the textures, maps, songs, sounds and web site for this mod.

## [Scavenger Hunt](http://planetunreal.gamespy.com/View7ace.html?view=Articles.Detail&id=82)

Scavenger Hunt was a mod I made for the original Unreal Tournament. 

## [Set](http://set.spilth.org)
