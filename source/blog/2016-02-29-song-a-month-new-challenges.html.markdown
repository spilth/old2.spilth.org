title: Song a Month - New Challenges
---

I've been recording and uploading a "song a month" for the past 7 months.  It's been a great experience, terrific motivator and helped me get better at a number of things by giving me a vehicle with which to practice them.

But in that time I feel like I have let myself get away with a number of things and I want to challenge myself on those things going forward.

## Lyrics

I don't spend enough time on lyrics. I don't put enough thought into them. I don't review them or try to come up with anything too interesting. They are generally an afterthought and something I do in the last few days out of desperation. 

### The Challenge

Spend more time on lyrics. Go through a process for writing lyrics. Check spelling. Check grammar. Check tense. Check the things I don't even know the definitions for (mixing first person and third person?). Go through several versions of lyrics before I get to the final version.

## Instrumental Tracks

I've done a few instrumental tracks, which is fine, but often those tracks are repetitive and use too much copy/paste of parts. It also means I don't have to write lyrics. Admittedly sometimes I did this because I had a cold and couldn't sing well enough for another song, but I've never been sick for a whole month, so...

### The Challenge

No more instrumentals. All songs must include me singing.

## Guitar Recording

For all of these songs I've just plugged my guitar directly into my audio interface and used the built-in guitar effects of Logic Pro X or Guitar Rig 5. But I recently got myself an amp, have a slew of pedals and I'd like to start using them for my guitar parts.

### The Challenge

Each song must include at least one guitar track recorded with a mic in front of an amp. 

## Mixing and Mastering

I have very little experience with mixing songs and next to no experience mastering songs. I use a very primitive method for mixing my songs and up until recently haven't done any kind of mastering. 

### The Challenge

Spend time learning how to mix and master songs. Leave myself time for mixing and make it a separate, defined piece of my process. Start using mastering tools to improve how the songs sound overall.
