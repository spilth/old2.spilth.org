title: Getting Started with Logic Pro X
---

Here are the things I do when I'm setting up a new machine with Logic Pro X.

## Download All the Sounds

From the `Logic Pro X` menu select `Sound Library`, then `Download All Available Sounds`

## Enable the Advanced Tools

- Press `Command` + `,` to bring up the Preferences window
- Click on the `Advanced` pane
- Click on the `Enable All` button
- Close the Preferences window

## Setup Input & Ouput Devices

- Plug in your Audio Interface
- Press `Command` + `,` to bring up the Preferences window
- Click on the `Audio` pane
- Click on the `Devices` tab
- Make sure `Output Device` and `Input Device` are set to your Audio Interface
- Close the Preferences window

## Enable 24-Bit Recording

- Press Command and `,` to bring up the Preferences window
- Click on the `Audio` pane
- Click on the `General` tab
- Check `24-Bit Recording`
- Close the Preferences window

## Label Audio Inputs

If you usually plug the same instruments into the same inputs on your audio interface all the time, it can be helpful to rename those inputs in Logic.  For example: my guitar is always in input 1, bass in input 2 and input 3 and 4 are for vocal mics.

- Click on the `Mix` menu
- Click on `I/O Labels...`
- For any input you want to rename:
  - Select the radio button under `User`
  - Provide a `Long` name
  - Provide a `Short` name

## Shortcut Keys

### General

### Panels

- `Y` = Library

- `Tab` = Cycle forward between Panels
- `Shift` + `Tab` = Cycle backward between Panels

### Transport

- `Space` = Play/Stop
- `Return` = Return to 0
- `R` = Start/Stop Record
- `C` = Toggle Cycle Mode
- `,` or `.` = Move 1 bar left or right
- `Shift` + `,` or `.` = Move 8 bars left or right

### Tracks
