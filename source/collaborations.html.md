title: Musical Collaborations
description: If you've found yourself here it's probably because I want to collaborate with you on a song!

Here's a rough idea of what I'd like to do:

- We get together for several hours on a weekend (or via the internet)
- We either write an original song or decide on a cover
- We record the song
- We mix it
- We take a picture of ourselves for the album cover
- We put it up on Bandcamp
- We don't charge money for it

If you'd like to hear some of my music:
